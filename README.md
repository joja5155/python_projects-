Data Visualisation in Python


There are several data visualisation projects that I did:
1. Nutrition.ipynb 

Visualising fast food menu items with python. With specify calories for each items. 
Trying to find patterns or relationship of calories based on different restaurants.

2. Risk Assessment.ipynb

This part is visualising the risks may happen to the truck leasing companies. 
If debitors cannot repay the loan they took. which I tried to find the pattern and problem that may have contributed significantly to why the may have chosen to default.
